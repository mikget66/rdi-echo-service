# RDI Echo Service

The **RDI Echo Service** is a React-based web application that allows users to upload or record Arabic audio, convert it to text, and generate an electronic voice output with the last word repeated three times (echo effect). This project leverages RDI's state-of-the-art services, **Kateb** (speech-to-text) and **Natiq** (text-to-speech), to deliver a seamless and interactive experience.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
